                </header>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Genomics research is "one of the hottest fields in medicine", yet we often lack accurate or clinically approved methods for diagnosis and treatment (McCarthy & Mendelsohn, 2016).</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge of Genetic Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>For example, we understand that the APOE4 gene does increase the risk of Alzheimer disease in individuals carrying one or two copies, but we are not able to correlate it to a prognosis due to the lack of fully understanding its interaction with other genetic or environmental risk factors.</p>

                    <p>In addition, large pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and others have ceased research into drug treatments for Alzheimer disease (Dwyer, 2018).</p>

                    <p>So without recommended genetic testing or approved drug therapies, what other ways are there to combat this disease? And how can we implement a personalized approach right now?</p>

                    <h2>The Science of Brain Health</h2>
                    <p>In the book, <em>The Age of Scientific Wellness: Why the Future of Medicine is Personalized, Predictive, Data-Rich, and In Your Hands</em>, the authors offer great insight into what the brain needs to function properly, especially as one ages.</p>

                    <p>Multiple factors such as diets sufficient in B-vitamin and omega-3 fatty acids, brain exercise, microbiome, sleep, social interaction, and limiting negative environmental factors like smoking can have a positive effect on brain health (Hood & Price, 2023).</p>

                    <h2>The FINGER Trial: A Promising Approach</h2>
                    <p>With current approaches to Alzheimer's treatment labeled as, "it's better than nothing", why not seek benefits in these basic lifestyle changes? With large gene panels available for Alzheimer's risk factors and many individuals understanding their risk solely using family history, it would seem prudent for these individuals to seek out any simple means to improve their neuronal health and possibly reduce any potential risk.</p>

                    <p>A randomized, controlled trial titled FINGER shows one way to combat this disease using methods that can be personalized.</p>

                    <p>In the study, they attempted to determine if multiple lifestyle interventions could improve cognition in at-risk individuals for dementia. The multidomain lifestyle changes in the experiment focused on "nutrition, exercise, cognitive training, and management of vascular risk factors."</p>

                    <p>The promising outcome of this trial showed these lifestyle changes to be beneficial for the at-risk elderly population, regardless of individualized factors such as sociodemographics, income, initial cognitive outcome scores, etc. (Rosenberg, 2018).</p>

                    <h2>Looking to the Future</h2>
                    <p>Research such as this is promising for the future. It provides evidence that these lifestyle changes can benefit brain health and it provides insight into the biological systems potentially related to neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                    <p>Future advancements in clinical genomics will hopefully lead to approved genetic testing for such diseases so that wellness approaches, like those seen in the FINGER trial, may be incorporated earlier in life for at-risk individuals.</p>
