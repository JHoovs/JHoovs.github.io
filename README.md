## About Me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Vivek Das

üëÄ I work on finding therapeutic target or biomarkers (prognostic/predictive) for multiple cardiometabolic (e.g. Chronic Kidney, Atherosclerosis, Diabetes, Liver, Neurodegenrative, etc.) diseases combining data-driven and knowledge-driven avenues by leveraging the integration of bulk and single cell multi-omics data alongside clinical data from human observational cohorts and clinical trials

üå± I currently collaborate, lead studies or projects and team of exceptional clinical data scientists and bioinformaticians involving single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, multi-omics data integration, clinical data integration to achieve the above

üíª I also worked on omics projects involving preclinical data with interventional designs e.g. knockout or drug treated at single cell or bulk multi-omics level

üíûÔ∏è I also collaborate on developing applied machine learning models using publicly available data with curious students or researchers and contribute to open science and open source modeling. I am fascinated by the potential of high-dimnesional and high-throughput biomedical data.
